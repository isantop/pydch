## Pydch

Release a Debian package based on a python distutils setup file.

### Installation

Install from the debian packaging. Or, from the python packaging.

### Usage

Just run pydch from within the project directory. You need a standard-formatted
setup.py file and a `/debian` directory, or it will fail. Probably not
gracefully. Yet.

### Pronunciation

"Pidch", like pitch (as in the verb for throwing, or the ball field)

In IPA, pɪd͡ʃ
